# globchanel

This packages provides an asynchronous version of standard library filepath Glob function.

The standard function does the job correctly. But in network environment, when files are located in remote crowded places,
 it is more efficient to deliver matches as long they are discovered instead of to collect them all and returns.


Most of the code comes from standard library.
